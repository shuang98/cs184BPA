    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>A common way of producing accurate and realistic 3D meshes and models is to use scanned data of the object you
      are trying to reproduce. Our project concerns itself with the important challenge of translating scanned points on
      an object's surface to an accurate 3D mesh that can be rendered digitally. To do this, we aim to create a program
      that takes in set of points in 3D space and outputs an appropriate mesh file that approximates the body of the
      originally sampled 3D object. To achieve this, we plan to implement the Ball Pivoting Algorithm
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170703143109/http://www.research.ibm.com/vistechnology/pdf/bpa_tvcg.pdf">(described
        here)</a>
      to construct the mesh from the set of sampled points. </p>
  </div>


  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
  <p>Our technical approach consists of three major parts: Input Preprocessing, The Ball Pivot Algorithm, and The Real
    Time Visualizer</p>

            Most of the 3D point data gathered was gathered online from 3D reconstructions published on the Stanford 3D
            Scanning Repository (<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/">here</a>). The file format of
            these reconstructions are <code>.ply</code>, which contain a list of vertex coordinates and a list of faces,
            with each face containing the indices of 3 vertices. On the right, we can see an example of a
            <code>.ply</code> file. The first three numbers of each vertex are the coordinates, while the last three
            numbers of each face are the indices of each vertex that make up the face.

            The ball pivot algorithm requires not only the vertex coordinates but also the vertex normals. In the paper
            we referenced in the abstract, they found the vertex normals by estimating them. However to avoid too much
            complexity, we instead reversed engineered the face data in the <code>.ply</code> files to reconstruct the
            vertex normals. Here is what an input file that we would feed to out ball pivot algorithm would look like
            (formatted in <code>.txt</code>).
          </p>
          <p>
            We found the normals for each vertex by calculating the average area-weighted face normals, similar to what
            we implement in Project 2. The input file contains six numbers three for the position and three for the
            normal vector

    <h3>Ball Pivot Algorithm</h3>
    <p>The ball pivot algorithm's basic idea is relatively intuitive. We simply simulate a ball (of some radius that we
      specify) rolling over our point cloud, outputing each face it rolls into.</p>
    <div class="ui grid">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="eight wide column">
          <h4>Data Structures</h4>
          <p>Here are the structures that our algorithm will use:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For <code>Vertex</code>, it contains both its position and normal. It also stores
              a boolean that tells us if a vertex is apart of the current mesh or not.
            </li>
            <li>For <code>Face</code>, it contains pointers to three vertices, as well as the
              position of the ball, if it were to sit on this face (for bpa). It also stores its own face normal
              One thing to note is that the order of the vertices a, b, c maintain the same winding order among the
              faces in the mesh.</li>
            <li>Similarly the <code>Edge</code> struct contains pointers to its two end vertices, as well as pointers
              to its two possible adjacent faces. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>The Edge Front</b>, <code>F</code>: A queue of edges to be pivoted over. Gernerally, evertime a new
            triangle is added to the current mesh its exposed edges are added to the front. Also, everytime an edge has
            been pivoted over, that edge will be popped from the front. In theory, all edges on the front are edges that
            only have the one face associated with them and are waiting to find the second face. (i.e the f1 attribute
            should be filled, will the f2 attribute should be still null)</p>

          <h4>Part 1: VoxelMap</h4>
          <p>
            Given that these point clouds contain a potentially very large number of vertices,
            our ball pivot algorithm, first and foremost, requires a way to efficiently lookup
            nearby vertices by location. Our VoxelMap structure will achieve this by grouping vertices
            by cubic volumes or voxels in a vector (similar to what we did in the Cloth Simulation Project) and putting
            each
            vector in an <code>unordered_map&ltint, vector*&gt</code>, so that we can index into a specific cubic volume
            in constant time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, given a location (x, y, z), we find all vertices within the same voxel, by flooring dividing and
            multiplying
            the length of the voxel to get the corner coordinates of the voxel. Then, we hash these corner coordinates
            to an
            integer: <br> <code>hash_key = prime_1 * x + prime_2 * y + prime_3 * z</code> <br>
            The vector of vertices is indexed at hash_key for that specific voxel.

          <h4>Part 2: Find Seed Triangle</h4>
          <p>The seed triangle is the initial triangle that the ball pivot algorithm starts from. Our goal is to find
            three points such that when a ball is sitting on top of the three points, no other vertex lies within the
            ball.
          </p>
          <span>To find this triangle we use the following steps</span>
          <ol>
            <li>We iterate through a list that contains every vertex starting at index <code>v_index = 0</code></li>
            <li>
              For each vertex in this list, we find the first one vertex that isn't used. If the vertex is used, then
              increment <code>v_index</code>, so next time we call this function we don't have to reiterate over already
              used vertices.
            </li>
            <li>
              For each unused vertex <code>vertex</code>, we find its neighbors using the voxelMap. We retrieve pairs
              <code>(n1, n2)</code> of vertices within the neighbors list. For the triangle <code>vertex, n1, n2</code>,
              find the <code>center</code> of the its resting ball (<a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11719168/how-do-i-find-the-sphere-center-from-3-points-and-radius">using
                this</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
              Iterate through <code>center</code>'s neighbors to check if any point lies within its radius. If the ball
              is empty use <code>vertex, n1, n2</code> as our seed triangle. Also check if this ball's center is aligned
              with the vertex normals, to see if it is lying on the right side of the mesh.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="eight wide column">
          <h4>Part 3: Ball Pivot</h4>
          <p>Given that our ball is pivoting over edge <code>e</code>, our ball pivot returns a candidate vertex, where
            the triangle contaning <code>e->a, e->b, candidate</code> is a valid face of the mesh.</p>
          <p>To simulate a pivot over the edge <code>e</code>, we mark the midpoint of the edge, <code>m</code>,
            as the anchor of rotation and the distance from edge's previous face's ball center, <code>e->f1->ball_center
            as the radius of our rotation.</code></p> Thus, a circle centered on <code>m</code> with radius
          <code>|e->f1->ball_center - m|</code> that lies on a plane perpendicular to edge <code>e</code>, describes all
          the possible new centers that our ball can pivot to.
          <p>Thus, for each <code>candidate</code> vertex in the neighboring vertices of <code>m</code>, we
            intersect the circle on <code>m</code> with the set of vertices that are <code>radius</code> distant from
            the <code>candidate</code>, (a sphere), to find the new ball's possible center. We then do similar checks to
            see if the new ball contains any points, and if it is aligned with the vertex normals.</p>

          <h4>Part 4: Join and Glue</h4>
          <p>Join and Glue are the operations that handle connections with the actual mesh.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Join:</b> Given <code>e(i, j)</code> and vertex <code>k</code>, such that <code>(i, j, k)</code> make
              up a valid triangle in our current mesh, we join them by adding the newly formed edges
              <code>e(j, k), e(k, i)</code> to the edge front.</li>
            <li><b>Glue:</b> When our candidate <code>k</code> forms a valid triangle with our edge <code>e(i, j)</code>
              but is already a part of the front, it is possible that either of our two new edges
              <code>e(j, k), e(k, i)</code> from the join operation could already be in the front (but in reversed order
              due to consistent winding order). Glue gets rid of these potential duplicates, essentially 'glueing' the
              two duplicate edges together.</li>

    <h3>Real Time Visualizer</h3>
    <p>
      Our visualizer used the rendering code from Project 2 Meshedit, but refactored in a way that it could handle our
      input formats. Our visualizer can render the point cloud, as white points and red lines as the mesh wireframe. We
      trigger the start of the mesh reconstruction through a key event, which starts a new thread designated for the
      ball pivot algorithm. Thus, we have two threads, the renderer thread and the reconstruction thread, as well as a
      shared list of edges that need to be rendered, which is protected by a mutex lock. Everytime our reconstuction
      outputs a triangle, it adds its edges to the shared list.

    <h3>Contributions</h3>
    <p>
      For the actual program, all three of us contributed equally, as we wrote most of the code as a group.
      Stanley wrote the code for the preprocessing, rendering, and some of the code for pivoting.
      Eric wrote the find_seed_triangle, as well as some of the join and glue operation.
      Kevin wrote the input gathering, and all of the voxel map operations.
